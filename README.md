# Wordhub: a simple app for memorizing foreign words

The app is used for learning words using flashcards.
Users create flashcards for words that they wish to memorize, and the dates of repetitions are planned according to the principle of [spaced repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).
The app is intended for everyday use. It is useful for people who read in a foreign language but who find their vocabulary insufficient.
The main advantage of this service over others is that even if the flashcard base is large, the number of flashcards planned for repetition on a given date is limited. But nevertheless all of them get learned.

The visual design is basic (Bootstrap's styles were altered only when necessary), but it's fully responsive: it's not harder to navigate on a phone than on a big screen.

The working app can be found on [wordhub.org](http://wordhub.org)
